Custom categories are html limited to 20 characters, but the server actually supports up to 40 characters.
* 40 characters isn't enough for me unless I somehow encrypt or compress the data.
* If I can't get all the data saved on a single custom category, I'll have to make multiple categories.
 * Alternatively, I can save preferences via cookies. This, however, prevents the script from staying syncronized across multiple browsers.
